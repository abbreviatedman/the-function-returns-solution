# The Function Returns

### Setup

1. Navigate to this directory in your terminal.
2. Run `npm install` to install the testing library.
3. Preferably in a full-screen terminal, run `npm test` to start testing.


### Workflow

You'll be working in **`main.test.js`** this time!, creating the variables needed with the values asked for, according to the specifications given in the tests. Check your terminal for feedback on which aspect of the problem you have yet to complete, and read the specifications' actual code implementation for extra help; it makes explicit exactly what outputs are expected given the test inputs.


### Guidelines:

* This time, **declare your variables using `let`**!
* Please do **not** call the functions; just declare them! You can call them to check for your own testing purposes, but then either delete or comment out the line.


### Tasks

    Create a variable named `greeting` and assign it to
if (typeof yellAt === 'undefined') {
  yellAt = undefined;
}

if (typeof fullName === 'undefined') {
  fullName = undefined;
}

if (typeof phoneCall === 'undefined') {
  phoneCall = undefined;
}
 the value of string 'Hello'
    Create a variable named `sum` and assign it to the value of 0
    Create a variable named `prod` and assign it to the value of 0


    Create a function named  `greet` that will take one parameter(string) and the function will change the value of greeting to 'Hello' plus whatever the value of the parameter is going to be
    Create a function named  `sumOfTwo` that will take two parameters(number), the function will change the value of sum to be equal to the sum of the two parameters
    Create a function named  `multiply` that will take three parameters(number), the function will change the value of prod to be equal to the product of the three parameters


Let's RETURN stuff (make sure to get re·im·burse)

    Create a function named  `sayHi` that will take one parameter and return a personalized greeting

   INPUT:  sayHi("Charlotte"); 

   OUTPUT:  "Hello Charlotte!";

   INPUT:  sayHi("Colin"); 

   OUTPUT:  "Hello Colin!";

    Create a function named  `returnWhatISay` that will take a string sentence and returns that sentence

   INPUT:  returnWhatIsay("Hello students, how are you"); 

   OUTPUT:  "Hello students, how are you";

    Create a function named  `divide` that will take two parameters and return the result

   INPUT:  divide(10,5); 

   OUTPUT:  2;

    Create a function named remainder that takes two parameters and return the remainder that we get when those two numbers get divided

   INPUT:  remainder(10,3); 

   OUTPUT:  1;
